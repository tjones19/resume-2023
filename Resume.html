    <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>
    <p>When I was five, I wanted to be an archaeologist—I wanted to travel the world, discover the unknown, share my learnings, and document my adventures. Now, I am an analytics and strategy consultant who loves making the biggest, hairiest ideas conceivable, executable, and successful. I am expanding my technical skills into web & app development, finding inspiration across the globe as an international digital nomad, and writing my first murder mystery novel. Same dream, less dirt.</p>
